# Overview ofProject: Kickstarter Analysis

Welcome to the first weekly challenge in this course. Your weekly challenges provide an opportunity for you to build on the skills you have learned in the module. These challenges are required and will be graded.

In this challenge, you will continue to exercise your Excel prowess! This time, you will create two new analyses: outcomes based on goals and outcomes based on launch date.

## Background
Louise’s play Fever came close to its fundraising goal in a short amount of time. Now, she wants to know how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals. Using the Kickstarter dataset that you’ve already combed through, you’ll visualize campaign outcomes based on their launch dates and their funding goals. You’ll then submit a written report based on your analysis and the visualizations you create.

## What You're Creating
This new assignment consists of two technical analysis deliverables and a written report to deliver your results. You will submit the following:

* Deliverable 1: Outcomes Based on Launch Date Chart
* Deliverable 2: Outcomes Based on Goals Chart
* Deliverable 3: A written analysis of the results (README.md)

## Analysis and Challenge

* Outcomes Based on Launch Date
*     It was a challange t find out monthly observations and show it using the chart.

* Outcomes Based on Goals
*     It was difficult finding the percentage of successful, failed and canceled outcomes of the plays from the subcategory title goals.

* What are two conclusions you can draw about the Theater Outcomes by Launch Date?
*     1.In the month of May and June the success rate of theater category was high than other months.
*     2.Cancelation rate is low over the period, that means theater category was successful.
* What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
*     It can be concluded that the Subcategory "Play" is successful, but the number of failed outcomes also increased over that time. 
* What are some limitations of this dataset?
*     The data does not included the country data/demographics.
* What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
*   1. We could find out which parent category is successful/not successful using pivot tables
*   2. We can do conditional formatting on “Percentage Funded” and on “Average Donation” with the help of color scales with “Highest” and “Lowest” value.
